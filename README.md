# PINN-for-ocean-waves
This repository contains code related to the paper "Physics-informed neural networks for phase-resolved data assimilation and prediction of nonlinear ocean waves" by Ehlers et al. (2025), which explores the use of PINNs to solve the potential flow equations, enabling data assimilation and prediction from sparse measurements.
